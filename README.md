A framework agnostic Javascript library that add powerful new features to
standard textareas.

MarkItUp! is not meant to be a “Full-Features-Out-of-the-Box”-editor. Instead it
 is a very lightweight, customizable and flexible engine made to meet the
 developer's needs in their web-apps.

 MarkItUp! is not a WYSIWYG editor, and it never will be.
